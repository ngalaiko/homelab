Changes to GoAccess 1.2 - Tuesday, March 07, 2017

  - Added a Dockerfile.
  - Added Amazon S3 bucket name as a VirtualHost (server block).
  - Added a replacement for GNU getline() to dynamically expand line buffer
    while maintaining real-time output.
  - Added --daemonize command line option to run GoAccess as daemon.
  - Added several improvements to the HTML report on small-screen devices.
  - Added option to the HTML report to auto-hide tables on small-screen
    devices.
  - Added --process-and-exit command line option to parse log and exit.
  - Added several feed readers to the list of browsers.
  - Added "-" single dash per convention to read from the standard input.
  - Added support for MaxMind GeoIP2.
  - Added the ability to read and follow from a pipe such as
    "tail -f access.log | goaccess -"
  - Added the ability to specify multiple logs as input sources, e.g.:
    "goaccess access.log access.log.1" while maintaining real-time output.
  - Added time unit (seconds) to the processed time label in the HTML/terminal
    output.
  - Added visitors' percent column to the terminal dashboard.
  - Changed D3 charts to dim Y-axis on mouseover.

  - Changed percentage calculation to be based on the total within each panel.
  - Ensure start/end dates are updated real-time in the HTML output.
  - Ensure "window.location.hostname" is used as the default WS server host.
    In most cases, this should avoid the need for specifying "--ws-url=host".
    Simply using "--real-time-html" should suffice.
  - Fixed issue on HTML report to avoid outputting scientific notation for all
    byte sizes.
  - Fixed integer overflow when calculating bar graph length on terminal
    output.
  - Fixed issue where global config file would override command line arguments.
  - Fixed issue where it wouldn't allow loading from disk without specifying a
    file when executed from the cron.
  - Fixed issue where parser couldn't read some X-Forwarded-For (XFF) formats.
    Note that this breaks compatibility with the original implementation of
    parsing XFF, but at the same time it gives much more flexibility on different
    formats.
  - Fixed issue where specifying fifo-in/out wouldn't allow HTML real-time
    output.
  - Fixed issue where the wrong number of parsed lines upon erroring out was
    displayed.
  - Fixed issue where the WebSocket server prevented to establish a connection
    with a client due to invalid UTF-8 sequences.

  - Fixed mouseover offset position issue on D3 bar charts.
  - Fixed possible heap overflow when an invalid status code was parsed and
    processed. This also ensures that only valid HTTP status codes are parsed
    >=100 or <= 599.
  - Fixed sluggish D3 chart re-rendering by changing how x-axis labels are
    displayed in the HTML report.

    This also ensures that in the absence of data, its output is not treated as
    error but instead it produces an empty report.
  - Added the ability to specify a WebSocket protocol (ws|wss) through
    --ws-url.
  - Added the request query string to the W3C format.

  - Fixed OS X build check of ncursesw.
  - Implemented a throttle mechanism for slow clients to avoid caching too much
    data on the server-side.

    formats such as %F or %T.
  - Fixed build issues on systems running GLIBC older than 2.9, such as RHEL <= 5.
  - Fixed issue where it wouldn't send the whole buffer to a socket causing the
    real-time-html WebSocket server to progressively consume a lot more memory.
  - Fixed memory leak when using getline and follow mode enabled.
  - Fixed some buffer initialization issues on read_line() and
    perform_tail_follow().

    functions. It also gives the flexibility to add children metrics to root
    metrics for any module. e.g., Request A was visited by IP1, IP2, IP3, etc.
  - Restyled HTML output.

    code 444 as 404.
  - Added --4xx-to-unique-count command line option to count client errors (4xx)
    to the unique visitors count.  Now by default it omits client errors (4xx)
    from being added to the unique visitors count as they are probably not welcomed
    visitors. 4xx errors are always counted in panels other than visitors, OS &
    browsers.
  - Added and updated operating systems, and browsers.

    will feed getopt_long with the extracted key/value pairs. This also allows the
    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  - Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  - Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  - Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.
  - Fixed potential memory leak on --log-file realpath().
  - Fixed Solaris build errors.
  - Implemented an on-memory hash database using Tokyo Cabinet. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to rely on GLib's hash table if one is
    needed.
  - Implemented large file support using an on-disk B+ Tree database. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead
    it uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.
  - Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces from keyphrases module.

Changes to GoAccess 0.7.1 - Monday, February 17, 2014

  - Implemented bandwidth per day, and host.
  - Implemented list of agents for specific hosts.
  - Rewrote hash tables iterative code to avoid the use of GHashTableIter, this
    way it works with all GLib > 2.0.0.
  - Various bug fixes and code cleanups (mainly in the subwin modules).

Changes to GoAccess 0.3.3 - Monday, September 27, 2010

  - Changed tarball's filename.
  - Fixed a request size parsing issue. Due to malformed syntax on the HTTP
    protocol, bandwidth was reset to 0. Ex. "HEAD /" 400 20392
  - Fixed a segfault when goaccess was executed without any options but with an
    additional unknown argument.

Changes to GoAccess 0.3.2 - Thursday, September 09, 2010

  - Fixed an agent parsing issue. As a result, operating systems were not
    properly counted.

Changes to GoAccess 0.3.1 - Friday, September 03, 2010

  - Added a color scheme implementation

Changes to GoAccess 0.3 - Sunday, August 29, 2010

  - Added a counter for total requests since initial parse was implemented
  - Added a more detailed and comprehensive browser and os report
  - Added bandwidth details for requested files
  - Added percentage details on modules 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11
  - Code cleanups
  - Fixed a potential segmentation fault when resizing main window
  - Fixed a segmentation fault on pop-up window search if haystack was null
  - Fixed invalid entries when parsing status codes
  - Implemented a real support for LFS - Handles files larger than 2 GiB on
    32-bit systems
  - Implemented support for "vhost_combined" log format
  - Changed position of data/graphs depending on # of hits

Changes to GoAccess 0.2 - Sunday, July 25, 2010

  - Added a keyphrases report coming from Google search engine. This includes,
    raw, cache, and translation queries.
  - Fixed a memory leak when invalid entries were parsed
  - Fixed a potential buffer overflow.
  - Implemented real-time statistics (RTS). Data will be appended as the log
    file grows. Equivalent to "tail -f" on Unix systems
  - Implemented screen resize functionality
  - Simpliflied creation of the "unique visitors" hash-key.
  - Simpliflied the "process_unique_data" function
  - Various small speed increases & code cleanup

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.2 - Monday, July 12, 2010

  - Fixed a segmentation fault when parsing logs with unusual request type. Ex.
    "GET HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1"

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.1 - Saturday, July 10, 2010

  - Added an enhanced error handling
  - Added an extra macro on configure.ac to check against GHashTableIter.
    ./configure might not check for glib 2.16 that introduced "GHashTableIter".
  - Added Glibc LFS
  - Cleaned up code a little bit
  - Fixed a segmentation fault when displaying the help text on x86_64.
  - Fixed assignments in conditions. In case the assignment is actually intended
    put extra parenthesis around it. This will shut GCC (and others) up.
  - Fixed casts associated with "g_hash_table_iter_next".
  - Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer types.
  - Fixed function declarations.
  - Fixed includes.
  - Fixed two format strings. (If the error was ever triggered, it'd most
    likely lead to a segfault)

Changes to GoAccess 0.1 - Tuesday, July 06, 2010

  - Initial release 0.1
