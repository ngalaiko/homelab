# Problem 

Hardest problem to solve so far: *describing 30min trivial problems turned out to be much less fun than I imagined.*

* [Problem #8](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-09): binary tree (fun, but always same)
* [Problem #9](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-10): array operations (boring and always same)
* [Problem #10](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-11): go basics (3 lines wtf)
* [Problem #11](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-12): a search tree
* [Problem #12](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-13): recursive algorithm (always same, sometimes hard to detect)
* [Problem #13](https://github.com/ngalayko/dcp/tree/master/problems/2018-07-14): string operations (super lame)

I will keep updating GitHub, but not sure about the website.
