## How to use
a) Apply the label `autoheal=true` to your container to have it watched.

b) Set ENV `AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all` to watch all running containers. 

c) Set ENV `AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL` to existing label name that has the value `true`.

Note: You must apply `HEALTHCHECK` to your docker images first. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/healthcheck for details.
